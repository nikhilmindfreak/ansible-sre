# variable preference in Ansible follows a specific order of precedence. The order is as follows:

# 1. arguments  ( e.g., command line arguments passed with -e or --extra-vars )
# 2. Task level  ( e.g., variables defined within a task )
# 3. variable files  (e.g., variables defined in files included with vars_files )
# 5. Play level  (e.g., variables defined at the play level in the playbook)
# 6. inventory  (e.g., variables defined in the inventory file)
# 7. role level  (e.g., variables defined in roles)
